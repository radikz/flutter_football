## Getting a Football Data API Token

This project uses the Football data to get the latest competitions, matches, and standings data.

Before running the app you need to [sign up on the Football data website](https://www.football-data.org/)

Once you have this, take a look at `constants.dart` file inside `utils/`, and add your API Token:

```dart
// constants.dart
const String API_TOKEN = "Your-API-Token";
```

Congrats, you're good to go. ðŸ˜Ž

## How to use it?

```cli
git clone
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
